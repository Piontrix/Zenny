# Server Recovery Guide - After git clean -fd

## 🚨 **What Happened**

You accidentally ran `git clean -fd` on your server, which removed untracked files:

- ✅ `cost-dashboard.sh` - **RECREATED** (see below)
- ✅ `zenny-backend/temp/` - **STILL EXISTS** (was tracked by git)

## 🔧 **Recovery Steps**

### **Step 1: Upload the Recreated cost-dashboard.sh**

From your local machine, copy the recreated cost dashboard to your server:

```bash
# Copy the cost dashboard script to your server
scp cost-dashboard.sh root@your-droplet-ip:/var/www/zenny/

# SSH into your server
ssh root@your-droplet-ip

# Navigate to application directory
cd /var/www/zenny

# Make the script executable
chmod +x cost-dashboard.sh
```

### **Step 2: Verify the temp Directory**

The `zenny-backend/temp/` directory should still exist since it was tracked by git:

```bash
# Check if temp directory exists
ls -la zenny-backend/temp/

# If it doesn't exist, create it
mkdir -p zenny-backend/temp/
```

### **Step 3: Test the Cost Dashboard**

```bash
# Run the cost dashboard to verify it works
./cost-dashboard.sh
```

You should see a beautiful dashboard with:

- System resource usage
- Cost estimates
- PM2 process status
- Monitoring logs
- Resource limits summary

## 📋 **What Was Lost and Recovered**

### **✅ Recovered:**

- **cost-dashboard.sh** - Recreated with enhanced features
- **zenny-backend/temp/** - Should still exist (git tracked)

### **🔍 Enhanced Features in New cost-dashboard.sh:**

- **Beautiful UI** with colored output and borders
- **Real-time resource monitoring** (Memory, CPU, Disk, Bandwidth)
- **Cost estimation** based on DigitalOcean pricing
- **PM2 process status** display
- **Monitoring logs** viewer
- **Resource limits summary** with alert/shutdown thresholds
- **Cost limit status** checker
- **Automatic bc installation** if missing

## 🚀 **Prevention for Future**

### **Before Running git clean:**

```bash
# See what would be removed (DRY RUN)
git clean -fd --dry-run

# Only remove specific files if needed
git clean -f specific-file.sh
```

### **Backup Important Scripts:**

```bash
# Create a backup of important scripts
cp cost-dashboard.sh cost-dashboard.sh.backup
cp update.sh update.sh.backup
```

## ✅ **Verification Commands**

After recovery, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check if cost dashboard works
./cost-dashboard.sh

# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# Check resource monitoring
tail -f /var/log/zenny/resource-monitor.log

# Check cost monitoring
tail -f /var/log/zenny/cost-monitor.log

# Verify temp directory
ls -la zenny-backend/temp/
```

## 🎯 **Quick Recovery Commands**

If you need to quickly recover in the future:

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@your-droplet-ip

# Navigate to app directory
cd /var/www/zenny

# Pull latest changes (includes cost-dashboard.sh)
git pull origin main

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x cost-dashboard.sh update.sh

# Test dashboard
./cost-dashboard.sh
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Always use `--dry-run`** with git clean to see what will be removed
2. **Keep important scripts in git** so they're not lost
3. **Use the cost dashboard regularly** to monitor your $6/month budget
4. **Set up regular backups** of critical configuration files

**Note**: The new `cost-dashboard.sh` is even better than the original with enhanced monitoring and a beautiful interface! 🎉
