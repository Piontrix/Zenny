							Zenny was born from the chaos of ghosted edits, DM delays, and unclear collabs.
							<br />
							<br />
							Our co-founder envisioned a platform where creators and editors could finally vibe over talent, not
							followers â€” anonymously, safely, and smoothly.
							<br />
							<br />
							Today, that vision fuels every pixel of Zenny. And this is just the beginning.
